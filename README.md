# 🚀 Next.js Modern Stack Template

A Next.js template that combines commonly used tools and libraries for building full-stack web applications. This stack is specifically designed to be optimized for AI coding assistants like Cursor.

## 🎯 Overview

This template includes [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router, [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the database, [Resend](https://resend.com) for transactional emails, and optional integrations with various AI providers and AWS services.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is my personal template with tools that I personally have experience with and think are solid options for building modern full-stack web application. Your preferences very likely differ, so feel free to fork and modify it for your own use. I won't be accepting pull requests for additional features, but I'll be happy to help you out if you have any questions.
